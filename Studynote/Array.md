1. Static array
◦ Fixed-length array
◦ The number of elements is determined at compile time and cannot change.
2. Dynamic array
◦ Variable-length array
◦ The number of elements can be allocated or resized at runtime (e.g., using malloc in C).
◦ When using malloc (or realloc) to increase the array size, remember to free the allocated memory
after use to avoid memory leaks.
